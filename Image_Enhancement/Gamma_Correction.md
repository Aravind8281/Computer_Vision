# Gamma Correction:

Definition:
Gamma correction is a non-linear adjustment of pixel values to correct the brightness levels in an image.

Real-World Explanation:
In simple terms, gamma correction compensates for the fact that the human eye does not perceive brightness linearly.

How It Works:
Raise each pixel value to a power (gamma value) to adjust the overall brightness.

Importance in Computer Vision:
Gamma correction is vital in computer vision to ensure accurate representation of intensity levels, especially when displaying or capturing images under different lighting conditions.

Use Case:
In the entertainment industry, gamma correction is used to adjust the brightness levels of images and videos, ensuring a consistent and pleasing visual experience across different display devices.
