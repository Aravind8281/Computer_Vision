# Histogram Equalization:

Definition:
Histogram equalization is a technique used to enhance the contrast of an image by redistributing the intensity values across its histogram.

Real-World Explanation:
Imagine an image where the intensity values are clustered in a narrow range. Histogram equalization spreads out these values to cover a broader range, making the image visually more appealing.

How It Works:
Compute the histogram of the image.
Calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the histogram.
Transform the original pixel values based on the CDF.
Importance in Computer Vision:
Histogram equalization is important in computer vision because it improves the visibility of details and features in an image. It's particularly useful when an image has low contrast or when there is a concentration of pixel intensities in specific ranges.

Use Case:
In medical imaging, where subtle details are crucial, histogram equalization can enhance the contrast of X-ray or MRI images, making it easier for medical professionals to identify abnormalities.
