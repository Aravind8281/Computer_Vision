# Contrast Stretching:

Definition:
Contrast stretching is a technique that expands the range of intensity values in an image to span the full dynamic range.

Real-World Explanation:
Imagine an image where the pixel intensities are confined to a limited range. Contrast stretching stretches this range to cover the full available intensity spectrum.

How It Works:
Identify the minimum and maximum pixel values in the image.
Apply a linear transformation to scale the pixel values to the full dynamic range.
Importance in Computer Vision:
Contrast stretching is essential in computer vision applications to enhance visibility and distinguish objects or details in images with poor contrast.

Use Case:
In surveillance systems, where capturing clear images is critical, contrast stretching can be applied to improve the visibility of objects in low-light conditions or challenging environments
