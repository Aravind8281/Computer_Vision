"""
Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD):
Definition:
SSD is a type of object detection algorithm that directly predicts object bounding boxes and class scores for multiple predefined bounding box shapes at each feature map location.

Real-world Explanation:
Rather than having a two-step process like R-CNN, SSD performs both region proposal and object classification in a single step.

Working:

Multi-scale Feature Maps: SSD uses feature maps at multiple scales to detect objects of different sizes.
Predictions: For each feature map location, SSD predicts bounding boxes and class scores for multiple aspect ratios.
Use Case:
SSD is often used in scenarios where a balance between accuracy and speed is required, such as real-time object detection in videos.

Influence on CV:
SSD introduced a more efficient approach to object detection by performing both region proposal and classification simultaneously.
