"""
You Only Look Once (YOLO):
Definition:
YOLO is an object detection algorithm that divides an image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly at each grid cell.

Real-world Explanation:
YOLO processes the entire image in one forward pass, providing real-time object detection.

Working:

Grid Division: The image is divided into a grid.
Predictions: For each grid cell, YOLO predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities.
Use Case:
YOLO is widely used in scenarios where real-time object detection is crucial, such as surveillance or robotics.

Influence on CV:
YOLO revolutionized real-time object detection by providing a good balance between speed and accuracy
