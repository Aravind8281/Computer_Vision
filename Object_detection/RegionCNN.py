Region-based CNNs (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN):
Definition:
Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) are a family of object detection models that use convolutional neural networks to identify objects in images. Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN are improvements to the original R-CNN model.

Real-world Explanation:
These models use a two-step process. First, they propose potential regions in the image that might contain objects (region proposal). Then, they classify and refine these regions using a CNN.

Working:

Region Proposal: Selective Search (in R-CNN) or Region Proposal Network (RPN in Faster R-CNN) proposes candidate regions.
Feature Extraction: Extract features from each proposed region using a CNN.
Classification and Refinement: Classify each region and refine the bounding box using fully connected layers.
Use Case:
R-CNN and its variants are used in scenarios where accuracy is crucial, such as in medical imaging or autonomous vehicles.

Influence on CV:
R-CNN marked a shift towards using deep learning for object detection, significantly improving accuracy. However, it can be computationally expensive.
