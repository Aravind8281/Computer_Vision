# Image Smoothing and Sharpening

Definition:
Image smoothing involves reducing noise and variations in pixel intensity, while sharpening enhances the edges and fine details in an image.

Real-world Explanation:
It's like applying a soft-focus filter to a photo to create a smoother appearance, or using a sharpening tool to bring out the fine details in a blurry image.

Working:
Smoothing is often achieved through techniques like averaging or Gaussian blurring, which reduce high-frequency components. Sharpening involves emphasizing edges, often done through operations like unsharp masking.

Importance in Computer Vision:
Smoothing helps in preparing images for subsequent processing steps, while sharpening aids in edge detection and feature extraction.

Use Case:
Example - Bilateral Filtering: Bilateral filtering is used for image smoothing while preserving edges. It's effective in applications like image denoising without blurring important structures.
