# Filtering 

Definition:
Filtering is a technique in image processing that involves modifying the intensity values of pixels based on a specified mathematical operation. Convolution, a common filtering operation, combines each pixel in an image with its neighboring pixels using a kernel or filter matrix.

Real-world Explanation:
Imagine applying a filter to a photograph to enhance certain features or remove noise. Filtering is akin to passing a transparent overlay with specific patterns over an image, altering its appearance based on the overlay's characteristics.

Working:
Convolution involves sliding a kernel over the image, multiplying the kernel's values with the corresponding pixel values in the image, and summing up the results. This process is repeated for each pixel, generating a filtered output.

Importance in Computer Vision:
Filtering is crucial for tasks like noise reduction, feature enhancement, and image smoothing. It helps extract relevant information from images and improves the performance of subsequent computer vision algorithms.

Use Case:
Example - Gaussian Blurring: Applying a Gaussian filter helps smooth an image by reducing high-frequency noise. This is commonly used before edge detection to improve the accuracy of the results.
