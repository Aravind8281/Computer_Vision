# Color Models (RGB, HSV, etc.):

Definition: Color models are mathematical models that represent colors using different components. RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) are common color models.
Real-World Explanation:

Real-World Explanation: Consider a paint store where colors are defined by mixing different amounts of primary colors. Similarly, color models define colors by combining primary components.
Working:

Working: RGB represents colors using varying intensities of red, green, and blue light. HSV separates color information into hue (type of color), saturation (colorfulness), and value (brightness).
Why It's Important in Computer Vision:

Importance in Computer Vision: Different color models serve different purposes. RGB is useful for displaying colors on screens, while HSV simplifies color-based image analysis tasks.
Use Case:

Use Case: In medical imaging, the HSV model might be used to segment regions with specific color characteristics, aiding in the diagnosis of certain conditions.
