# Pixel

Definition: A pixel, short for "picture element," is the smallest unit of a digital image. It represents a single point in an image and contains information about its color.
Real-World Explanation:

Real-World Explanation: Imagine a digital image as a grid of tiny dots, where each dot is a pixel. Each pixel has a specific location and color value, collectively forming the visual content of the image.
Working:

Working: The color of a pixel is typically represented by combining values for Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). For example, a pixel with RGB values (255, 0, 0) would be a bright red pixel.
Why It's Important in Computer Vision:

Importance in Computer Vision: Pixels are the building blocks of images. Understanding and manipulating individual pixels is crucial for various image processing tasks, such as filtering, transformations, and analysis.
Use Case:

Use Case: In image processing, you might perform operations on pixels, like changing their colors, blurring them, or enhancing certain features. For instance, detecting edges by analyzing the changes in pixel intensities.
