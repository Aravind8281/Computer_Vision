Edge-based Segmentation:
Definition: Edge-based segmentation detects boundaries or edges in an image to separate different objects.
Real-world Explanation: Locating boundaries between objects based on abrupt changes in intensity or color.
Working: Edges are detected by identifying significant changes in pixel intensity.
Use Case: Useful in robotics for object manipulation, where precise object boundaries are critical.
Influence on CV: Enables the identification and extraction of object boundaries for further analysis
