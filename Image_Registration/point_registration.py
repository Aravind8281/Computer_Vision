Definition: Point-based registration involves aligning images based on corresponding points or landmarks in the images.

Real World Explanation: Think of aligning two images of the same scene by identifying and matching specific points such as corners, intersections, or distinctive features.

Working: Algorithmically, the registration involves finding a transformation (translation, rotation, scaling) that minimizes the differences between corresponding points in the two images.

Use Case: Aligning medical images taken at different times or from different devices for comparative analysis.

Influence on CV: Point-based registration is fundamental for various computer vision tasks where images need to be aligned before further analysis, e.g., in object recognition or tracking.
