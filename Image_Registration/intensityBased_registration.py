Definition: Intensity-based registration involves aligning images by optimizing the similarity of their intensity distributions.

Real World Explanation: Aligning two medical images with different contrasts or lighting conditions.

Working: It involves finding a transformation that maximizes the similarity metric (correlation, mutual information) between pixel intensities.

Use Case: Image fusion for improved visibility in aerial or medical imaging.

Influence on CV: Important for various tasks like medical image analysis where images may have different acquisition conditions
