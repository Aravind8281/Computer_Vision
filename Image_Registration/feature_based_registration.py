"""
Definition: Feature-based registration involves matching distinctive features extracted from images to align them.

Real World Explanation: Aligning two satellite images by identifying and matching key features like buildings or natural landmarks.

Working: Features (corners, keypoints) are detected in both images, and a transformation is computed to align the feature sets.

Use Case: Merging images from different sensors for panoramic views.

Influence on CV: Vital for tasks like object recognition where images need to be aligned for effective feature matching.
