"""
    Definition: PoseNet is a machine learning model designed for real-time human pose estimation using a deep neural network.
    Real-world Explanation: PoseNet can estimate the key points of a person's body in real-time from camera input, providing a skeleton-like representation of the pose.
    Working: It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict joint positions based on the input image.
    Use Case: Augmented reality applications, fitness tracking, interactive installations.
