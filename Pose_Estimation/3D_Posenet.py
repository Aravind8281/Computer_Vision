"""
    Definition: 3D pose estimation involves determining the positions of key body joints in a 3D space from a 2D image or video.
    Real-world Explanation: Extending beyond 2D, 3D pose estimation reconstructs the spatial positions of joints in three dimensions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the subject's pose.
    Working: Often requires additional information, such as camera calibration parameters, to convert 2D joint positions into 3D coordinates.
    Use Case: Augmented reality, robotics, biomechanics, sports performance analysis.
