"""
    Definition: 2D pose estimation involves determining the positions of key body joints in a 2D space from a 2D image or video.
    Real-world Explanation: Given an image or video, 2D pose estimation identifies the locations of joints such as shoulders, elbows, and knees, representing the body's posture in a 2D plane.
    Working: Typically involves using algorithms or neural networks to detect and localize key body joints based on features present in the 2D image.
    Use Case: Human-computer interaction, gesture recognition, action recognition in videos, sports analysis.
